# As-salamu alaykum 👋🏻
# Education 📚
I'm Muslim Umalatov. I was born in Chechen Republic and completed education at the Prezidential Lyceum. After finishing high school, I moved to Istanbul to pursue my university education. Now,
I am a student at Istanbul Medeniyet University, majoring in Computer Engineering. 
# Programming Languages 🛠
During my time in high school, the examination required proficiency in a programming language. I chose the C++ programming language. In university, we are studying the elder sibling of C++, the C programming language. Since C is not object-oriented, we also began learning the Java programming language. So, I have knowledge in C/C++ and Java.
# Preferences 💡
I love both the hardware and software aspects. However, I don't have a specific area of focus yet. I'm thinking about creating my own operating system, but for now, it's just thoughts...
